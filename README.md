## How to run the code
- Clone the repository on your PC
  (_go to Git Bash → go to the directory where you want to add the folder, type "cd  your location" in Git Bash → type "git clone https://github.com/euctrl-pru/R_leaflet_route_map.git" in Git Bash_).
- Open the **R_leaflet_route_map.Rproj** file.
- Within the project, open the **region_route_map.R** script and run the code.

## Notes
- The data used to generate the map is the top 5 city pairs data by region in 2024.  
- The countries on the map are coloured based on the STATFOR regions.
